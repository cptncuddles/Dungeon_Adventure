# First Steps Projects
---
## Summary
These are various one of projects that I was given a prompt for and sometimes given specific guidelines to practice
different programming skills.

### Scrabble
The prompt for this project was to create the framework for a terminal based Scrabble game. The object of this project was
to practice creating and manipulating **dictionary** structures.

### Bored Tourist
This prompt was more guided than the rest of the projects. The prompt to help a person decide where they wanted to go visit
while on a vacation. The objective was to create different helper **functions** and learn more about *namespace* and *scope* in regards
to **functional programming**.

### Bastafazoole
This prompt dealt with helping a burgeoning restraunt business better organize their locations with a homogenized menu. The objective
was to explore the principles of **Object Oriented Programming**, specifically with *user defined classes* and *class methods*.

### Car Selection
This prompt dealt with creating a script to help customers decide what vehicle they should purchase. The objective was to further 
practice the concepts of **OOP** as well as delving into the basics of different **data structures**. A very basic *logic tree* allowed for the
most straightforward implementation of the prompt. This also gave me the first glimpse into *Machine Learning*.

### Dungeon Adventure
This is a totally unique terminal game that plays out like a version of Dungeons and Dragons. The prompt was to create any terminal game
that used any of the techniques learned up to that point including: 
-OOP
-user defined functions
-data structures
-user input

I began by defining different classes, with unique class methods. And instituting a very simple logic tree that traverses across different nodes allowing
for multiple variations of the game depending on user defined inputs.
